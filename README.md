EBS_Volume_Convertor


Description:
As a Cloud Engineering team, we take care of the AWS environment and ensure it complies with the organizational policies.
We use AWS cloud watch and AWS Lambda to govern the resources according to the policies.

For example, we Trigger a Lambda function when an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is created. We use Amazon CloudWatch Events. CloudWatch Events allows us to monitor and respond to EBS volumes that are of type GP2 and convert them to type GP3.

This project is very helpful for practising AWS concepts with Python
